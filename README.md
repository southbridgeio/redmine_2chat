# redmine_2chat

This plugin is used to create group chats in instant messengers.

The `redmine_2chat` can be used to create a group chat associated with an issue and record its logs to the Redmine archive. Associated group chats can be easily created via the `Create <Platform name> chat` link on the ticket page. You can copy the link and pass it to anyone you want to join this chat.

There're currently Telegram and Slack supported to create chats in. You can also create your own platform adapter and register it.

Please help us make this plugin better telling us of any [issues](https://github.com/centosadmin/redmine_2сhat/issues) you'll face using it. We are ready to answer all your questions regarding this plugin.
